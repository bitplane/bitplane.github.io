# Software

I started programming when I was 6 or 7 years old, before I could read and
write. This sounds like a lie, but it was actually possible at the time - on
the ZX Spectrum you'd press one key and it'd type out an entire keyword, and
you'd need to actually do this in order to load a game. By sticking a line
number in front of it, the command would be saved as a program, which you
could write to tape later on.

Almost 40 years later I'm still at it, and still enjoy it too. Here's some of
the things I've managed to index.
