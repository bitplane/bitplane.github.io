The challenge was my idea and only three people could spare the time, the
rules were simple and the deadline incredibly tight: make a Minesweeper
clone in under five hours. This is the one I made:

The five hours included creating all graphics, writing the code and testing
it too, so donâ€™t expect polished graphics, sounds, fancy menus or anything
like that!
