# Space Irrvaders

A while ago we had a "make a Space Invaders clone in a weekend" challenge on
the
[Irrlicht forums](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17992).
Having written lots of arcade games over the years I decided to try something
different: an Invaders clone with a cylindrical coordinate system, mapped onto
a circle.

The result was a fun game:

As usual it contains no sounds, also due to its hurried nature the design
is really awful. Someday I might refactor it and make the source code
something to be proud of, but no promises here! You can grab a
[Windows binary](irrvaders.zip) if you just want to play it, which will be
a lot more fun that reading the source.
