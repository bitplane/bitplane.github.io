SysV `banner` for Amiga and MS-DOS: [banner.zip](banner.zip)

Banner 1.00

Bitplane 99

There was a banner command in Xenix, it was pretty good for sending messages
to other peoples terminals.
I wanted it, so I made it for the Amiga.

Feel free to copy this program (don't forget this doc though...), upload it
to Aminet, or even hack in to it and change the '#' to something else.
Its all yours.

The text is baised on topaz 8, 9 chars fit on a row on my screen (Hires Lace)
so thats all you get

Usage:

        Banner <txt> [txt][txt][...
        eg)
        banner "its a" "banner or" three "or four!"

Recompiled for the pc...

Shame about the intel outside bit, now its on the PC.
I am embarrased to say that the Amiga version (BANNER) is BIGGER
(yes BIGGER) than the PC version (BANNER.EXE) :(

Sorry Microsoft... I take it all back
(well not all of it)
