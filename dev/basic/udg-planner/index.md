# Gareth's UDG planner

todo: Talk about the toil of making sprites on the ZX spectrum. Scan the UDG
planner which is in my old bedroom somewhere.

My dad was a builder, he could hang a door or fit a bathroom or build a house,
but he couldn't program a VCR and never knew that numbers even have bases.
Teaching me binary so I could create sprites and making the UDG planner was far,
far outside his comfort zone and took dedication. But he did it.

People will probably remember him as a cowboy builder due to dementia arriving
before retirement did, or angry and sweary due to back pain diagnosed as hip
pain, or stoned due to the meds, and, well, the weed.

I know you'll never read this, or understand it if I read it to you. And only
sometimes remember who I am. But I remember the UDG planner. I love you dad.
Thank you.
