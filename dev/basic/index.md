# 🐣 Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Cackronym

I started off programming on a 16k ZX Spectrum, which my uncle sold cheap to my
dad in 1985 saying "you want to get your Gareth into programming, it's gonna
be big." Turns out he was right.

I had a Speccy from age six until I was 13, when I finally upgraded to an Amiga.
I don't have any of my old tapes digitized - I might have on my old Amiga hard
drive but it's not to hand and I don't have a TV for it.

For the sake of history I ought to share some anecdotes.
