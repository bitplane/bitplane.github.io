# Resize OCX

An invisible pane in VB6 that will resize its children, kinda like responsive
design for desktop apps in the late 90s/early 2000s.

It was crazy that Windows didn't ship with something like this, forcing
everyone to make their own crappy implementations.

You can get my crappy implementation here: [download](resize.zip)
