# Filestore.mdb

Back in the old days, MS Office came with Microsoft Access, a database program
with VBA - Visual Basic for Applications - and a "Form" (window) designer.
I was working for the Department of Work and Pensions, and we had mail blocking
software that prevented us from sending programs and scripts around, so I made
this VBA app that takes a file from your filesystem, puts it in the database
and you can send the Microsoft Database file to its destination.
