One Christmas the IT staff at the Department for Work and Pensions had a
Secret Santa. One of the lads, Mark Deans got the latest issue of gentleman's
top shelf magazine [Razzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzle_\(magazine\))
as from his mystery (presumably female; it's a softcore mag) gifter, and as he
opened it to take a peek, someone else, (it might have been me) snapped a
glorious trophy of him donning an exaggerated, pervy smirk while peering into
it.

I'd been messing about with the Win32 API at the time, wondering how Clippy
could exist in a non-rectangular window. The answer was the "region API" which
conveniently came with functions for shaping a window to a bitmap.

So I made an EXE that hides in the background for a few minutes, then Mark pops
up in business suit and tie, Razzle in hand, his eyes turn red in an act of MS
Paint, focus on the pages, then he sinks back down to whence he came.

As you can imagine, it got added to the start menu of almost every machine in
the office.

If I ever find the binary I'll put it here. Pretty sure it's on an old hard
drive somewhere.
