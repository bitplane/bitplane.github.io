# Visual Basic

Being a BASIC programmer from birth, then an AMOS BASIC programmer as a teen,
doing Pascal in college, then a VB6 course... It was pretty obvious that I
was gonna pick up Visual Basic in all of its forms (including C#, which is VB
without the stigma and isn't listed here).

Here's some stuff I made in it over the years:

* [2d23d](2d23d) - VB6 app to turn pixel art to voxels.
* [auto-nudge-repeater](auto-nudge-repeater) - Annoy your friends over MSN!
* [animating bitmaps](animations) - A footnote in history.
* [batnball](batnball) - A very very bad breakout style game in VB6.
* [collapsedirs](collapsedirs) - Flatten a filesystem.
* [deansy](deansy) - Region calls for a prank popup.
* [dat2url](dat2url) - Piracy helper from back when that was rife.
* [deansy](deansy) - A bit of office fun.
* [file2bmp](file2bmp) - Mail filter evasion, because anarchy.
* [filestore](filestore) - Mail filter evasion, where you can't run EXEs.
* [iniedit](iniedit) - An INI editor written in VB6.
* [loadrunner-citrix](loadrunner-citrix) - Some helpers for load testing Citrix.
* [resize](resize) - Resize your children in Windows form apps.
* [spiral](spiral) - Just a bit of fun using the curved line API.
* [wmp-scr](wmp-scr) - Windows Media Player screensaver.
