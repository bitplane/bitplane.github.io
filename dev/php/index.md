# Personal Home Page

LAMP stack is the reason Silicon Valley stole the entire web, so I obviously
spent a fair bit of time and effort making various things in PHP. But most of
them were sat in a web directory and were lost to the mists of time.

Not that it's much of a loss, it's not a great language and I didn't do that
much in it. Here's what did survive:

* 📃 [file list](file-list) -
  A nice Apache style file list with custom icons and MIME types
* 🌐 [Irrlicht WordPress](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) -
  Made the old website easier to post articles and stuff, using modern WordPress
* 🖼️ [ImgSize.com](imgsize) -
  Show an image in its real size, so you can use your screen to measure things.
