# SVG renderer for Android

A proof of concept - a direct mapping between SVG XML and the graphics
calls on Android. The idea was to unpack and create the graphics data
for my Android apps after downloading, when you first run them.

This would keep apk sizes respectable, because Android's approach to
asset management is disgusting bloat.
