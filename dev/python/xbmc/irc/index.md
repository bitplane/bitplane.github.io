# XBMC IRC

People used to download their media from IRC at the time, and as a bit of a 
muso, my contribution was to create a GUI for MP3 file sharing over IRC. The
idea was that you use the remote to search for files, download them, and
anything you did download was then shared with others in the channel. The bots,
although not part of the community, would act as a cache for the real users who
hung out in the channel.

I think this was the first IRC client I wrote, and supports
