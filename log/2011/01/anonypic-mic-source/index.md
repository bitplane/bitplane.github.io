# Anonypic and Microphone source drop

Since I’ve not updated these two Android projects in a while, at risk of total
future embarrassment (I’m still a Java newbie) I’ve decided to dump the source
code on GitHub so others can make use of it. Details are on the
[Anonypic](/dev/java/anonypic) and [Microphone](/dev/java/microphone) project
pages.

If you fix any bugs, please send a pull request and I’ll do my best to merge
them in, but keep in mind this is also my first attempt at using git; expect
schoolboy errors there too!
