# A Series of Reinforcement Tubes

Ages ago I remember this How It's Made video for hose pipe and there were
excessive layers of rubber being added to the thing. It was surreal.

Watching the US version back on YouTube, it seems there weren't as many as
I remember. So I made an extended cut.

Send for one or more reinforcement layers.
