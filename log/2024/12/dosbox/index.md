# ðŸ’¾ dosbox here too

The asciinema thing works well, but dosbox uses a framebuffer so I can't record
my old apps. So I decided to add another player.

This time I've embedded [js-dos](https://js-dos.com), same trick as before. Add
the `dosbox` feature to the front matter and if there's a `whatever.dos.zip`
link in a bullet point, it'll run it in a DOS emulator.
