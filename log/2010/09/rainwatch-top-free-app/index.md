# Rainwatch featured on Android Market

Sometime yesterday my app [Rainwatch](/dev/java/rainwatch) was added to the
“top free” list on the Android Marketplace, showing in 5th position in the News
and Weather section. This is strange because it’s only 32nd in the “top free”
list on the market on Android devices, but hey, I’m not complaining!

I guess I’d better make a promotional image for Market and update the
screenshots so they actually look like recent versions of the app!
