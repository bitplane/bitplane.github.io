# My first ascension!

After playing [nethack](https://nethack.org) for about three years, bitplane
the wizard finally
[ascended to the status of Demigod](nethack.txt).

Nethack is by far the most difficult yet addictive game I have ever played and
although I rate it highly, I don’t recommend it unless you’re a glutton for
punishment.

My three year addiction isn’t over yet, I think I’ll play another role next time
I have a spare few.. uh.. days.
