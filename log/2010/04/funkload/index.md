# Funkload SVN access

So.. I got given funkload SVN write access on grounds of a single bugfix.
I did intend to share the repot generation and diff tools I wrote for the
BetFair Poker 2 load testing CI pipeline, but I never got permission to
share the code with the project.

Which is a shame because they were pretty good.
