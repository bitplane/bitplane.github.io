# New website

Decided to get myself a shiny new website. I decided to copy Klasker and go for
e107, I can even use it as one of those modern blog thingies so I can rant about
stuff, or just share out my pagerank by linking to things I think are cool.

If you're here looking for something to download, the old CMSimple site is will
be available until I have moved everything here.
