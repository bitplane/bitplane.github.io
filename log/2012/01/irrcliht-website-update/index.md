# Irrlicht website update

The WordPress version of the [Irrlicht website](https://irrlicht.sf.net/) is now
live, which means we can edit pages and post news articles using an online
editor, users can post comments and we can even appoint community editors to
post stuff without giving them rights to the filesystem.

Expect lots more activity there in the future :)
