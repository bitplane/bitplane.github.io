# Favicon to PNG project moved

I just made a small bugfix to my .favicon to PNG script, but thought it would be
a better idea to put this somewhere better than a static web page.

So Iâ€™ve moved it over to [GitHub](https://github.com/bitplane/favicon-to-PNG)
where anyone can play with it, hopefully it will be more useful there.

Enjoy!
