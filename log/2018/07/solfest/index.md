# ‚ô£ Solfest fancy dress

Alice in Wonderland themed fancy dress party at Solfest this year, so Kath and
I made playing cards for the adults while the girls both dressed as Alice.

We used duvet covers for the backs, which had a nice texture, and sheets for
the front. I split the files up in InkScape and we spent days ironing them on
to the things before glueing them onto a foam back, added straps.

If I remember correctly the SVG files are from Wikimedia commons.
