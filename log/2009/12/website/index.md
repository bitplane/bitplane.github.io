# Website Update

I’ve finally got around to editing the Simplish template and adding pages for
some of my old software projects. There’s some links at the top up there, hover
over them and you get a nice drop-down menu with a list of projects.

The meat of this is JavaScript stolen from another theme and some PHP code
gratuitously pasted into my header, this isn’t IP theft, and not just because
it’s the season of sharing! This is what’s great about free software licenses.
