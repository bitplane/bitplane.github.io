# More Sidewiki Leaks

Apparently the British press have been barred from publishing any of Tiger
Woods’ sex pictures, and the block somehow extends to
[Internet news sites](https://www.theregister.com/2009/12/12/tiger_woods_accenture_ads/).
They aren’t even allowed to mention what the block is about, so I’ve taken the
liberty of filling in the blanks on Google SidewikiLeaks and will update it to
include links to pictures when they are inevitably released:

It makes you glad that America has freedom of the press, even if Britain
doesn’t.
