# Milk Scanner

A 3D scanner using a tray of milk. The item submerges, you watch the pixels
turn white and log the Z axis. It was inspired by .. uh, I can't find the link
right now but it wasn't the first.

Here's a link to another one that someone made
[7 years later](https://hackaday.com/2016/04/16/milk-based-3d-scanner/).

SFM techniques made this approach worthless, but it's still pretty cool.

If I can find the code I'll link it somewhere
