# Songs in Code

I'm a bit late on commenting on this Twitter meme as it's over a month old, like
all memes it's a variation of something
[as old as the Earth](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206035852/http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/info.html)
and just recently revived. The concept is simple, just write a song lyric or
title as a code snippet, set it as your status and share with others by linking
the [#songsincode](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23songsincode) hashtag.
That's all.

Someone's even made
[a database](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206035852/http://songsincode.com)
of all the posts where you can vote on the entries. Most are boring and just
consist of lyrics padded out by punctuation, but there are some quite creative,
non-obvious ones which use programming constructs to infer the lyrics. Here's
[mine](https://web.archive.org/web/20091211215253/http://songsincodedb.com/poster/twitter/bitplane)...

```c++
class BillieJean : public girl
{ 
  int i; 
  relationship lover;
public: 
  BillieJean(relationship &me) 
  : lover(!me), i(1) {} 
};
```

```php
body() { 
  print '<body>' . body() . '</body>'; 
} 
love() { 
  body();
}
```

```javascript
/* mon = 255; tue=wed=0xaaaaaa; */ 
if (friday)
  love.insert(me);
```

Some of my favourites (with slight edits):

```bash
video$ kill -9 `ps -ef | grep radio*`
```
