# Remove junk words from Samsung predictive text dictionary

I couldn’t find anything on the web about this, so I’m posting it here:

Say you’ve accidentally added a junk word to your Samsung phone’s T9 dictionary,
and you want to remove it, this can’t be done without resetting the phone to
factory settings. Nobody wants this.

However, if you repeatedly type the same word over and over again and select the
correct one, it will eventually adjust the priority. New words start with a
priority of 5 more than the other words in that word group, so just select the
word over and over again and don’t type the new one.

Gay;Icy;Hay;Haw;Gaz,
Gay;Icy;Hay;Haw;Gaz,

I’m respectable again!
