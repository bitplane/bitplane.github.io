# PISG is up again

Now that I have a reliable shell, #irrlicht once again has an
[eggdrop bot](https://eggheads.org), which will be useful because we haven’t had
any way to add new operators for at least two years. The bot is logging and
there’s a cron job to upload PISG output to the
[stats page](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064353/http://irrlichtirc.g0dsoft.com/).
So anything you do say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against
you...
