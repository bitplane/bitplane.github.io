# Irrlicht 1.5.1 for OSX

I just uploaded an [OSX release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/irrlicht/files/Irrlicht%20SDK/1.5/1.5.1/irrlicht-1.5.1-MacOS.zip/download)
for Irrlicht 1.5.1, it includes an installer and installs Irrlicht as a shared
library (Irrlicht.framework). This will be the first of many platforms
supporting Irrlicht as an official, installed shared library.

Update: Now available from the
[Apple website](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/irrlichtengine.html),
though they credited bitplane.net and removed the
[YASS](https://web.archive.org/web/20100310213553/http://www.yass-engine.de/)
credit for the screenshot. Next time Iâ€™ll submit a shorter description!
