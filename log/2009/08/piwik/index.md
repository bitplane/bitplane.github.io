# Piwik in, Google Analytics out

Iâ€™ve stopped using Google Analytics and have now moved over to
[Piwik](https://www.piwik.org/). I donâ€™t have that many visitors, but there are
still lots of [good reasons](https://web.archive.org/web/20130812145634/http://piwik.org/blog/2009/06/7-reasons-why-your-commercial-site-needs-piwik/)
to use Piwik. Itâ€™s better for everyone if I keep hold of my own stats instead of giving it all
to Google and I may even do some Piwik hacking in the future.

Getting it working in Gallery2 was a bit of a pain, so I
[updated their wiki for them](https://web.archive.org/web/20130812145634/http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:How_To_Add_Piwik_Analytics_to_my_Gallery_2),
but other than that itâ€™s about the same as installing Google Analytics.

Subscribers are welcome to see my laughable stats ðŸ˜€
