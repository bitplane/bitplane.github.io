# Irrlicht Nightly Builds 2.0

[Irrlicht nightly builds](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://irrlicht.convextech.ca/)
by ConvexTech are back again, not only with D3D9 compiled in to the Win32-gcc
builds but we even get VisualStudio AMD64 builds too! A big thanks to Marc
Burns for providing this service :-)

I’m hosting a [mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://irrlicht.mirrors.bitplane.net/),
it’s not much compared the the overhead of compiling the builds, but every
little helps, right?
