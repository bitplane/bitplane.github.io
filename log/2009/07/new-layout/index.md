# New website layout

So I’ve finally decided to bite the bullet and install WordPress.
I’ve never been much of a fan of the blog format, but over the past couple of
weeks I’ve made a few interesting toys without binary demos and the e107 CMS
I was using as a file store couldn’t index them. The old gallery isn’t ideal
for random screenshots either. So I decided this site needed a makeover; a
new layout which has permanent locations for files, a gallery and links to my
SVN repositories.

So the HTTP 301 script is up and redirecting, and the new format for
bitplane.net goes like this-

* A gallery to store screenshots, photos and artwork.
* SVN repositories for [games](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://svn.bitplane.net/games)
  and another for [apps and scripts](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://svn.bitplane.net/misc)
* My [file dump](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://dump.bitplane.net/), for temporary storage
* A new [files subdomain](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://files.bitplane.net/), for permanent file storage.
* …and this blog, to index new stuff.

So, what new stuff? Well over the past couple of weeks I’ve made some loaders
for Irrlicht. A [TAR loader](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://irrlicht.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/irrlicht/trunk/source/Irrlicht/CTarReader.cpp?view=markup)
(and fixed gzip loading in Irrlicht), a [Windows Icon loader](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://svn.bitplane.net/misc/trunk/irr/archive%20loaders/ICO/)
and a [Windows PE binary resource loader](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://svn.bitplane.net/misc/trunk/irr/archive%20loaders/RSRC/)
and just for fun a [FIGlet font driver](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://gallery.bitplane.net/main.php?g2_itemId=326).
Also, over the past couple of months I’ve spent a bit of time [learning to sketch](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://gallery.bitplane.net/main.php?g2_itemId=292),
and have scanned a couple of them so I can see my progress. Finally, I made a
[Photosynth of Glastonbury Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20091207064343/http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=aa81a86c-05e7-4681-b762-a88173aa146d),
which actually captures some idea of the scale of the place.

That’s my first post out of the way. I promise not to blog unless I have something interesting to show, or less often, say.
