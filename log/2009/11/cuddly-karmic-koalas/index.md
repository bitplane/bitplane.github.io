# Ubuntu 9.10: works for me!

I was a bit worried about upgrading to Ubuntu 9.10 after El Regâ€™s
[scare stories](https://www.theregister.com/2009/11/03/karmic_koala_frustration/)
claimed that nine out of ten people had problems with the automatic upgrade.

I guess their stats were skewed, nine out of ten people who are complaining on
the Ubuntu forums were complaining about the upgrade, which is nothing like nine
in ten people having problems.

Worked fine for me on two different machines, my only problem is that the
battery charge profile on my laptop was lost.
