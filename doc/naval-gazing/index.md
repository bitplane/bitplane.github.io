* [Musings on Cargo Cult Consciousness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oFiHwuuS8LAYqRNFh/musings-on-cargo-cult-consciousness)
  Less Wrong didn't like it. Partly because of the style, and partly because
  it calls out the irrational Christian heritage that's baked into the
  culture of science, and partly because it offends their religious beliefs
  as computationalists. I've not had any decent arguments against the content
  though.
  I'd like to break it down into a bunch of different articles, and eventually
  make them into a series of videos.
