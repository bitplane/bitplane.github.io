## Speed Modelling

Back in #irrlicht on Freenode (which, like everyone else, moved to libera.chat
after [the coup](https://matt-rickard.com/the-fall-of-freenode)), we used to do
speed modelling exercises. I think it was Armen who came up with the idea, but
it usually consisted of him, myself, Rooly, Micha, Midnight and a few others.

It goes like this: Someone picks a noun at random, keeping it as broad and open
to interpretation as possible, the timer starts and we have 20 minutes to carve
it out of cubes in Wings3D, [like so]().

If at the end it looks like it has promise, keep hold of it and make textures
for the thing. If not, then it was a bit of practice. I only made a couple of
okay ones, I'm a programmer art guy ðŸ¤·

## Kiri Engine

Jess and I spent a bit of time making 3D models for Roblox Studio, by scanning
them in using Kiri Engine.

Wanting to save them for after Roblox close them off, which will likely happen
if they can put higher walls in their garden, I put them on the web here for
others to use:
